Hi, my name is Ben, and I'm a senior at Princeton University studying Computer Science. I am fortunate to be advised by Professor Narasimhan, working with PhD candidates [Vishvak Murihari](https://www.vishvakmurahari.com/) and [Shunyu Yao](https://ysymyth.github.io/).

Currently I'm interested in demystifying and improving reasoning capabilities of AI, through mediums such as logic puzzles and coding domains. I'm also broadly interested in understanding knowledge storage in LLMs, and its interaction with contextual knowledge in multi-task settings. 

I love making and critiquing music. So much so that I built a generative AI [pop music composition tool](), deployment in progress. Also check out my [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/4KsS5vBRtowHg6ATcBpoSG?si=pN8NPmWcSDWvuumXRXqyTg) where I post some interesting creations!

Always happy to chat about anything. 

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
