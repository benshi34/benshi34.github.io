Hi, my name is Ben, and I'm a recent graduate of Princeton University where I received my undergraduate degree in computer science. I'm originally from Changsha, China, and moved to West Virginia in the 5th grade. I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Karthik Narasimhan](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~karthikn/), as well as Dr. [Shunyu Yao](https://ysymyth.github.io/). Previous I was an intern at Meta.

Nowadays, I'm particularly interested in building agent tools and frameworks for Human-AI collaboration in reasoning environments**, briding the gap between human intent and model capability. Optimistic about tools built on **reasoning-based retrieval**. Evals are also a big part of this: there needs to be more utility-based evals that return transferrable signals to downstream tasks.

<!-- **demystifying and improving reasoning capabilities of AI**, through mediums such as logic puzzles and coding questions.  -->

My undergraduate thesis was on analyzing and improving LLM performance on competitive programming, where I received the Sigma Xi Book award for outstanding undergraduate research and publication record.

In my free time I love making and critiquing music. So much so that I built a generative AI [pop music composition tool](). I also love to produce music + sing.

Feel free to contact me at [x]@princeton.edu, where [x] = benshi.
